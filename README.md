## 1. String Concatenation
It is easy to join two strings together like this string1 + string2.

Another way to get the desired result would be with string1.concat(string2)

ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.

`+ `, `.concat()` & `.join()` will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!

If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string.

## 2. Roman Numeral Encoder

Create a function taking a positive integer between 1 and 3999 (both included) as its parameter and returning a string containing the Roman Numeral representation of that integer.

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. In Roman numerals 1990 is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII. 1666 uses each Roman symbol in descending order: MDCLXVI.

Example:

```solution(1000); // should return 'M'```
